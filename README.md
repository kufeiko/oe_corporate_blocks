## Description

This is a Drupal module that contains the EC corporate blocks. These are currently the Footer and Site Switcher. 
The Site Switcher is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.x.
Others will be added as requirements emerge.

## Installation

The recommended way of installing the OpenEuropa Corporate Blocks module is via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

```bash
composer require openeuropa/oe_corporate_blocks
```

### Enable the module

In order to enable the module in your project run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/drush en oe_corporate_blocks
```

## Development setup

You can build the test site by running the following steps.

* Install all the composer dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

* Customize build settings by copying `runner.yml.dist` to `runner.yml` and
changing relevant values, like your database credentials.

* Install test site by running:

```bash
./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

Your test site will be available at `./build`.

### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can build a development site using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with the provided configuration.

Docker provides the necessary services and tools such as a web server and a database server to get the site running, 
regardless of your local host configuration.

#### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Configuration

By default, Docker Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base configuration and it's provided by default.
The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new 
services.
If a service is defined in both files, Docker Compose merges the configurations.

Find more information on Docker Compose extension mechanism on [the official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

#### Usage

To start, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It's advised to not daemonize `docker-compose` so you can turn it off (`CTRL+C`) quickly when you're done working.
However, if you'd like to daemonize it, you have to add the flag `-d`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer install
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

Using default configuration, the development site files should be available in the `build` directory and the development site
should be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/build](http://127.0.0.1:8080/build).

#### Running the tests

To run the grumphp checks:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

To run the phpunit tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

To run the behat tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/behat
```
